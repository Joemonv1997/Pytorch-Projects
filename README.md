# Sign-Language
***
This is the Repository Developed to use deep learning model to create Sign Language Detection.

This repository uses Tensorflow as the main library to train the model and distinguish between different sign language

## Steps 
***
* Create a folder for different classes
* Using Image Data Generator in keras for model to learn and visualize 
* Download pre-trained model 
* Use pretained model as well as Flatten and Dense to train the model
* Test the model uding test images 
* Analyze the model using real world scenario

## Libraries Used
***
* Tensorflow
* shutil
* os
* numpy
* pandas

To the almighty God and to all who helped me to learn Tensorflow and Deep Learning
